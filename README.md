## 📦 Installation and Setup

To get started, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:Mind2Screen-Dev-Team/thousand-sunny.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd thousand-sunny

# Install dependencies and set up the project
make setup

# Copy example config and fill the value of configuration
# The `.env` file for deployment time and sql db migrations:
#   + NOTE: There is a some key no need to fill a value, that is:
#     - SERVICE_CORE_VERSION
#     - SERVICE_ASYNQ_VERSION
cp .example.env .env

# The `config.yaml` file for application configuration.
#   - config.yaml: this is for running local or for (make go-run a=core)
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml

# Run LOCAL for simplify step

# Run the application
make go-run a=core

# Run On PROD / LOCAL and deploy into Docker

# The `config.[core|asynq].yaml` file for application configuration.
#   - config.[core|asynq].yaml: this is for running local or for (./deploy.[core|asynq].yaml <version> [rebuild])
cp config.example.yaml config.asynq.yaml
cp config.example.yaml config.core.yaml

# Make it script deployment executeable
chmod +x ./deploy.*.sh

# IMPORTANT:
#   1. Run your docker apps before run this deploy scripts
#   2. Run the deploy setup first
#   3. Run the deploy script

# For setup core app
./deploy.core.sh setup

# For setup asynq app
./deploy.asynq.sh setup

# NOTE:
# Version must follow the sematic versioning format 'vX.Y.Z' (e.g., v1.0.0).
# Please refer on this docs: https://semver.org/

# For deploy core app, ex: v0.0.1
./deploy.core.sh <version>

# For deploy asynq app, ex: v0.0.1
./deploy.asynq.sh <version>

# For force re-build docker image to deploy core app, ex: v0.0.1
./deploy.core.sh <version> rebuild

# For force re-build docker image to deploy asynq app, ex: v0.0.1
./deploy.asynq.sh <version> rebuild
```

## ⚙️ Makefile Commands

The Makefile provides a set of commands to help you manage and interact with your Go project efficiently. Below is a list of the available commands:

### Note:
- Please escape strings in environment variables in file .env when handling errors, especially when using migrations.

### Setup Commands

- **`make setup`**: Sets up the project by installing necessary tools like `goose` and `sqlc`.

### Go Commands

- **`make go-tidy`**: Cleans up the `go.mod` file by removing unnecessary dependencies.
- **`make go-run a=<application>`**: Runs the specified application.
- **`make go-run a=<application> c=<configuration file>`**: Runs the specified application with configuration.
- **`make go-build a=<application>`**: Builds the specified application.

### Migration Commands

- **`make migrate-up`**: Migrates the database to the most recent version.
- **`make migrate-up-by-one`**: Migrates the database up by one version.
- **`make migrate-down`**: Rolls back the database version by one.
- **`make migrate-status`**: Displays the migration status of the database.
- **`make migrate-create n=<migration_name>`**: Creates a new migration file.

### Seeder Commands

- **`make seeder-up`**: Runs the seeders to populate the database.
- **`make seeder-down`**: Rolls back the seeders by one version.
- **`make seeder-create n=<seeder_name>`**: Creates a new seeder file.

### Utility Commands

- **`make print-path`**: Displays the current `PATH` environment variable.
- **`make migrate-help`**: Provides help on migration commands.
- **`make go-help`**: Provides help on Go commands.

### Examples

```bash
# Setup your project workspace
make setup

# Run a Go application (example: core, asynq)
make go-run a=core

# Migrate the database to the latest version
make migrate-up

```

These commands make it easy to manage your Go application, including its dependencies, database migrations, and proto file generation.
